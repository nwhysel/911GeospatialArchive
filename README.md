Preliminary Assessment for a 9/11 Geospatial Archive

9/11 Geospatial Archive Assessment
The main activity of the 9/11 Geospatial Archive Assessment was to identify and meet with institutions, agencies and individuals who may hold 9/11 artifacts and assess the extent of existing material and willingness to donate or receive archived materials, and to identify materials that can be donated and/or reproduced, for example digital files, storage media, physical maps, correspondence and other documentation related to the rescue and recovery efforts at the World Trade Center after the September 11, 2001 attacks. These items would form the basis of a 9/11 Geospatial Archive (the Archive) to be developed as a flagship project of the Center for Geospatial Innovation.

The Center for Geospatial Innovation (the Center) is proposed as a premier center created to support research and education related to geospatial technologies in New York City and nationwide. We feel that the Archive would be a key component of the Center’s activities and also, given the national interest in 9/11 history, would represent a jewel around which the Center could promote its activities and seek funding for its operations. New York City, and the United States overall, has not experienced a more devastating and impactful event than the attacks of September 11, 2001 since Pearl Harbor. The effort to respond to the disaster was unprecedented in New York City and produced technological advancements and a collaborative model that may not have been possible under normal conditions. It is our goal that the Archive will serve to document this historic moment and the heroic efforts of the personnel and volunteers who participated in the rescue and recovery.

We have created a list of over 650 items that have been described in a Google document:

Included in this spreadsheet is item level description for materials that have been collected by the research team, archivist Noreen Whysel and Center for Geospatial Innovation Director Alan Leidner. Electronic materials have been saved to a Dropbox account.
